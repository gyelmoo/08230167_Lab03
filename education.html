        <p>Samtse College of Education introduced both challenges and opportunities
          for growth. The shift from structured school learning to greater independence 
          initially made it difficult to manage assignments and stay focused. Over time, 
          I adapted to the interactive learning style, which encouraged active participation, 
          critical thinking, and a deeper understanding of the subjects. Engaging with diverse 
          coursework and collaborative projects helped me enhance my presentation skills, time 
          management, and teamwork. 
          <br>
          These experiences not only strengthened my academic abilities 
          but also shaped my personal growth, making my college journey both enriching and memorable.</p>
